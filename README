Lunch-Bunch
==============

This was a group project for an HCI class at MIT.  It was developed using
the Android SDK in Eclipse.  Its purpose was to explore
the user interface aspects of developing a mobile application.  This project
is compatible with Android OS 4.0+ (Ice Cream Sandwich).

This project has a developed front end, with a mostly mocked backend.  There
is no server functionality, notifications are faked off of timers, etc.
Developing a backend was not within the scope of the class.

Lunch-Bunch is a front-end mock for an app that would allow its users to
coordinate lunch (or any other sort of event) with their peers.  A user
can create and receive lunch invites as well as browse, accept, or decline
invites to lunches created by friends.  A user can also be notified about
an upcoming lunch they have rsvp'd to through Android's notification
system.  The app comes with a fake set of internal contacts that allow
the user to explore all of this functionality, and the user will receive
notifications based off of the timer from the installation of the app.
